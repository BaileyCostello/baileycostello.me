					<h3>Tools Used: UXPin, Photoshop, Qualtrics, Validately, Optimal Workshop, InvisionApp, SharePoint Designer, RealtimeBoard</h3>

					<p>Farm Credit Services of America is a leading innovator in agriculture's technology. As such, they needed a solution to keep the organization's teammates up-to-date with the fast paced development.

					I worked with the company's top technology leaders, crafted surveys, held interviews, & usability tests. I planned all meetings, wrote the copy, & created low fidelity & high fidelity prototypes as well as developed the SharePoint site to tell Farm Credit Services of America's story of innovation.</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">Independent Work While Working with Others:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">Everything stated in this project report was ideated, designed, and developed by yours truly. I was guided by FCSAmerica's Leader of User Experience to plan what processes/exercises to perform and when to perform them. I reported my work to the Leader of Application Development; the business owner of the project. I took my questions and designs, prototypes, or research studies to the User Experience Team for feedback. I set up many other meetings with stakeholders when I had questions about content or development.</p>

					​<h2 class="primary-font">Problem Statement:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">A large portion of employees are oblivious to the innovative planning, research, and development within Strategic Services; the driving force for the association's growth. Teammates are unaware of what Strategic Services is and are blindsided when new products are announced.

					My goal is to ensure employees have the resources to understand what Strategic Services is and does, the integral role the team plays for the association, and the resources to stay up-to-date with projects, feel involved, and aware of the company's direction.

					[Figure 1: Linear summary of major UX work. In addition to this timeline, I also developed the solution.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font" >The Survey:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">I never thought that I could spend an entire week writing and rewriting questions for my Qualtrics survey. I surveyed seven employees, each outside of Strategic Services and with different job roles.

					Goal: identify how much teammates knew about Strategic Services, what information they might be interested in, and if it would help them do better work.

					Takeaways: Looking back, the types of questions I asked were about the unknown future for the group I surveyed. Participants inherently respond to the questions with ingenuous agreement. Surveying a group with experiences of learning about and working next to Strategic Services would have captured more relevant information. The survey's biggest insight revealed that participants knew almost nothing about Strategic Services.

					[Figure 2: User's response to the question, "In your own words, what is Strategic Services and what do they do?” Even the participants that knew about Strategic Services didn't know the whole story.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">The Solution Space:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">I compiled the list user needs based on survey results and the list of business goals from an interview with the business owner.

					Goal: align objectives of users and business facets to create the solution space for the project.

					Takeaways: Creating a visual Venn diagram was effective in guiding my thought process as I solved for the goals and kept me on track as I built the solution. It was also a powerful diagram to explain the intention behind my designs.

					[Figure 3: The magic happens where business goals intersect with user needs.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">The Question Set:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">I created a versatile list of questions for testing all parts of my web-based solution; including the information architecture, wireframe, high fidelity prototype, and the working solution. I iterated through seven versions of questions to ask study participants as the solution was molded and more clearly defined.

					Goal: Use the same questions throughout testing the project to keep data and feedback consistent.

					Key Takeaways: I gained a new perspective on the power and ambiguity of language. Changing a single word in a sentence made considerable differences in how people responded. Writing, as well as asking, the right questions are some of the most important skills a user experience designer/researcher can have.</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">The Information Architecture Testing:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">I was able to quickly iterate on tests of the information architecture with an Optimal Workshop tree test. The information architecture determines a user’s mental map of the solution.

					Goal: Design the information architecture to group the site’s content in a way that matches the user’s thought process.

					Through lots of repetition, I validated my word choices when study participants had an almost 100% success rate on half of the questions and an 84% average success rate overall.

					Takeaways: You. Are. Not. Your. User. The question that I thought would be the easiest to successfully complete was consistently the most failed question on every iteration of the tree test.

					[Figure 4: You have no idea how accomplished I felt after I got this many success cases. Question five was particularly tough for users, but it represented a small use case.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">The Ideation Process:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">I like to take down a few notes on the same paper I am sketching on; this keeps the most important components at the front of my mind. 

					Goal: Quickly come up with many different ideas through rapid-fire hand-drawn ideas for the solution.

					[Figure 5: Some rough sketches to ideate on content and flow.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">The Wireframes:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">In my low-fidelity wireframe prototype, the user lands on the site and sees a full width image representative of Strategic Services. The order of presentation creates a natural-flowing, conversational introduction to Strategic Services, read as, “This is who we are, what we do, and what we are interested in.”

					Goal: Deliver content for the primary user: those unaware of Strategic Services and/or how the department affects the association.

					Takeaways: Wireframing takes some time, but producing a believable prototype speaks for itself. Wireframing is not about getting every pixel in place; when a prototype gets to a testable state, test it. Time is expensive, use it wisely by failing fast and iterating more.

					[Figure 6: I always get a good chuckle when people say they love or hate the colors used for the wireframe.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">The High-Fidelity Prototype:</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">The real-life images of the department tell the story of Strategic Services without words. The quotes provide another layer of the humans behind Strategic Services. I want someone to go to the site and recognize a coworker. Additionally, I replaced the conversation style flow to a tree-like flow. As the user scrolls, he or she gets more in-depth details.

					Goal: Give the site, along with Strategic Services a sense of reality. Create a high-fidelity prototype that can be tested, translated into a developers hands, and serve as a presentation piece that can be talked to during stakeholder meetings.

					Takeaways: Adding colors and pictures added life to my prototype and copyright is a very difficult process. Getting to a place that is both easy to understand and written in as few words as possible takes time, practice, and lots of synonym searching. Content organization is not necessarily best in a top-down logical view. People won't read everything on a page. The organization should cater to the most important information on the page.

					[Figure 7: The front page and main design of the site. Cameron and Shirley look much less scary in real life, those are placeholders.]</p>

					<h2 class="primary-font">Final Words</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">This project was an enriching experience as I explored multiple layers of the in-depth design process. I greatly expanded my networking, communication, and design skills. I was challenged to defend my design decisions, balance feedback and ideas with the true goals of the project, and, of course, I discovered that my heart and mind want to explore and develop as a user experience expert.

					Note: While this write up mainly focuses on the design process, I also developed the composition into a mobile-responsive SharePoint site. I mainly utilized HTML, CSS, Photoshop, and SharePoint Designer to recreate the design as a working site.</p>
