			<p class="tertiary-font">Farm Credit Services of America is a leading innovator in agriculture's technology. As such, they needed a solution to keep the organization's teammates up-to-date with the fast paced development. <br/> I worked with the company's top technology leaders, crafted surveys, held interviews, & usability tests. I planned all meetings, wrote the copy, & created low fidelity & high fidelity prototypes as well as developed the SharePoint site to tell Farm Credit Services of America's story of innovation.</p>
