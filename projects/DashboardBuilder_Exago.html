					<h2 class="primary-font">BI & Data Analytics Dashboard Builder</h2>
					<h3>Exago Inc.</h3>
					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Project Summary</h2>
					"The project of many firsts." This was my first project at my first post-college job working as my employer's first dedicated user experience (UX) designer.

					A short two months into my first job out of college, I was navigating how I fit into my role as Exago’s first user experience designer at the same time the Dashboard Builder project began. This project was nothing short of an application overhaul.  Following my team, internship experiences, intuition, and google – we solved a diverse set of usability issues; as well as validated the designs through testing.
					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Problem Statement</h2>
					Exago’s Dashboard creation experience is outdated, confusing, and frustrating to use; overall a weak point for Exago in the competitive business intelligence (BI) market. The three main design challenges for this project include the workflow for building charts, the information architecture, and updating the style of the application.
					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Timeline</h2>
					6 months

					<h2 class="primary-font">Key Learnings</h2>
					Working under tight timelines
					Working with a complex product
					Stakeholder Interviews
					Arranging, Facilitating, and Observing Lean Usability Testing
					Managing communication between development, product, and design teams
					Form Design

					<h2 class="primary-font">Introduction</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">When you think of business intelligence and data analytics the first thing that likely comes to mind is a beautiful Dashboard. What isn’t thought of is the knowledge and work required to create this effortless looking display of key metrics and charts.  There’s a steep learning curve similar to something like Microsoft Excel. The goal of this project was to shorten the learning curve and modernize the interface.</p>

					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Business Goals and User Needs</h2>

					<p class="secondary-font">Business Goals
					The sales team should focus on selling, not explaining. Create an intuitive experience that does not overwhelm, confuse, or distract a potential customers from their most important question: Can Exago’s Dashboard Designer solve their business problems?
					 
					The outdated interface affected the perceived quality of the application. The front end affects not only our sales team’s credibility, but also our customers credibility; because our customers embed our software into their own products.
					 
					User Needs
					Shorten the learning curve with a clear information architecture, showcasing the application’s features, encourage exploration, and enable easy to build and great looking visualizations.
					Workflow for Building Charts
					We interviewed two teammates who build Dashboards and other data analytics reports for our customers.
					 
					“I don’t really use the visualization builder. I build my charts in the Advanced Report Designer and add those to my Dashboard,” said Nick Cortina. The Advanced Report Designer is Exago’s powerhouse application for building reports and charts, however, most people don’t have the technical knowledge to use it.
					 
					The old system for building charts would make decisions for the user with intentions of being convenient. This “feature” ended up being unpredictable with no clear, repeatable path to create or take apart a chart.
					 
					We removed the magic and narrowed the workflow down to one, predictable path. We also implemented a clear and visible reaction for any change made by the user.
					Figure 2: Comparison of old and new workflow for building charts. You can see the new workflow has many fewer decisions [right].
					 
					Learnings
					Instead of using our time to test and refine the original workflow, the team assumed we needed something new. Many meetings later, we landed close to where we started. We clarified the workflow, but still had many of the same problems.</p>

					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Consolidate and Simplify Filters</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">There were 4 different types of filters that, to the user, inevitably did the same thing: limit the data on the Dashboard.
					 
					After spending hours with the development team, I gained an intimate understanding of the functionality and constraints necessary to simplify filters. I determined the three most important questions to answer and only represented those in the top level of the interface: 
					 
					“How do I create a filter?”
					“What is this filter filtering?”
					“Where did this filter come from?”
					 
					Figure 3: Shows how the menu answers the three most important questions for filters.
					 
					Learnings 
					In the beginning, I wanted the interface to answer every single question about filters. However, many of the explanations were unrelated to the user’s goal, and therefore just clutter.
					 
					I realized the user’s mental model doesn’t have to represent the system accurately for it to be usable. For example, a car steering wheel is made up of many parts, however, to steer the car the user only needs to know how to turn the wheel.
					
					Figure 4: Old versus New filters menu. The old menu [left] has all options at the top level, there’s too much information to understand at a glance. In the new menu [right] filters are visually separated and summarized for easy scanning and identification.</p>
					 

					<h2 class="primary-font">Information Architecture</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">Test after test, I watched participants fail to find what they were looking for, nor could they even find their way back to previous menus. This would happen multiple times for each participant.
					 
					Figure 5: The old information architecture at its worst. On the right you see a stacked menu, with global options above the, too similar, tile-specific options. On the left you will also find a few, isolated options.
					 
					 
					Figure 6: The new information architecture. Global options are separated from the tile specific options, which are under the global options and to the right.</p>

					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Exago’s first Usability Testing session</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">Up until this point, most product research took place during the planning phase. I saw a lack of communication and validation with users during the design phase and became persistent that testing was important.
					 
					Seeing is believing; with no allotted time for UX research, I made time for usability testing. I chose this method because in addition to testing the proposed solution, I was able to gather task completion metrics, and ask questions about end user’s specific needs.
					 
					Learnings:
					Asking the right questions at the right time is the hardest part of usability testing. I caught myself asking leading questions, missing opportunities to ask questions, and speaking when I should have been quiet.
					 
					Oftentimes I didn’t dig into questions enough. I would ask something like “Why did you decide to click on X?”  with a response like “I was looking for a way to change this.” I would stop there, instead of continuing down the line of questioning with “How are you trying to change that?”
					 
					Finally, I should have explained the goal of testing to the observers. I scared the CTO with a minimal prototype that was confused for a close-to-final product, and the debrief conversations after each session derailed to talking about unfeasible changes rather than focusing on participant’s actions.

					<h2 class="primary-font">A note on Visual Design</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">In addition to understanding the problem and working with other team members to implement the solution as smoothly as possible, I also sharpened my visual design skills.
					 
					I made a point for us to start using labels, bigger text, and colors that pass the WCAG AAA and AA accessibility test. Many visual improvements line up with accessibility improvements.
					 
					The marketing team’s graphic designer crafted most of the icons and collaborated with me in design sessions to incorporate more color to the still, mostly black and white, Sketch files. She taught me the overall composition’s seemingly small, final touches go a long way to refining the overall look of an interface.
					 
					Figure 7: Adding color and taking it away in other cases, softening edges, and subtle shadows make a world of difference in the final product.
					Next Steps</p>
					 
					<h2 class="primary-font">Retrospective Meeting</h2>
					<p class="secondary-font">I set up a meeting to capture what the project team thought went well, what didn’t go well, and what specific steps we can take to improve.

					The team determined our “steps to improve” are to introduce more testing on design projects. For me, this is an absolute win. I proved the value of usability testing.
					 
					Continuous Internal Testing
					After the 6-month project timeline, I have tested 13 internal employees. There are diminishing returns as known issues are out of scope, and small issues should be ignored and tested by real end users.
					 
					Continuous External Testing and Feedback
					As of my writing, we have only just published these changes and have received a few positive sentiments from clients regarding understanding and style improvements. I look forward to reaching out and asking more specific questions.</p>
