Definition: Define the Solution Space based on the primary usability issues and 6-month timeline. Development and Delivery: (Note: Due to the timeline, design meetings, testing, and iterating on the solution took place concurrently with coding the solution.) Build Low Fidelity Prototype to test the hypothesized improvements to chart building and information architecture. Build High Fidelity Designs to ensure design decisions are translated accurately and clearly defined for the development team. Usability Testing using the prototype, we observed client end users complete tasks to find issues with the proposed solution. Testing Result Recommentations and Design Iterations to discuss usability test findings. Determine what is high priority and can be fixed within the time constraints. Iterate on High Fidelity Designs based on the usability test findings. Release a Near-Complete, Coded Solution Internally and perform more usability testing sessions with Exago employees. Release the Solution to Customers. Request for testing and feedback as clients upgrade to the newest version of Exago's BI software.">

Potential customers with a hard requirement for Dashboards would often buy competitor products. Satisfy the expectations to quickly and easily build beautiful Dashboards, like the competition. User Needs: I watched test participants get lost within the interface over and over again. Multiple times per session.

				<h2>Workflow for Building Charts</h2>


				 
				<h2>“I don’t really use the visualization builder.</h2> <p>I build my charts in the Advanced Report Designer and add those to my Dashboard.  - Nick Cortina.</p> <p>(Note: The Advanced Report Designer is Exago's powerhouse application for building reports and charts, however, there is a much greater learning curve to use it.</p>

				<img src="assets/Old_Chart_Workflow.png" class="img" alt="Visualization of the old chart building workflow. It includes two different pathways and an error that could have been prevented.">
			</div>
			<div class="center-column-two">
				<img src="assets/New_Chart_Workflow.png" class="img" alt="Visualization of the new chart building workflow. Including only three steps and removes the error state.">
			</div>
				<p>Figure 2: Comparison of old and new workflow for building charts. You can see the new workflow has many fewer decisions [right]. </p>
				 
				<p>The old system for building charts would make decisions for the user with intentions of being convenient. This “feature” ended up being unpredictable with no clear, repeatable path to create or take apart a chart.
				<br/>
				We removed the magic and narrowed the workflow down to one, predictable path. We also implemented a clear and visible reaction for any change made by the user.</p>
				 
				<h3>Learnings</h3>
				<p>Instead of using our time to test and refine the original workflow, the team assumed we needed something new. Many meetings later, we landed close to where we started. We clarified the workflow, but still had many of the same problems.</p>

				<h2>Consolidate and Simplify Filters</h2>
				<p>There were four different types of filters that mattered on a technical level, but to the user, filters inevitably did the same thing: limit the data on the Dashboard.
				<br/>
				I determined the three most important questions to answer and only represented those in the top level of the interface: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How do I create a filter?</li>
					<li>What is this filter filtering?</li>
					<li>Where did this filter come from?</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="center-column-one">
				<img src="assets/Old_Filter_Window.png" class="img" alt="Visualization of the old chart building workflow. It includes two different pathways and an error that could have been prevented.">

				<img src="assets/New_Filter_Window.png" class="img" alt="Visualization of the new chart building workflow. Including only three steps and removes the error state.">

			</div>	 
				<p>Figure 3: Shows how the menu answers the three most important questions for filters.</p>
					 
				<h2>Learnings</h2> 
				<p>I realized the user’s mental model doesn’t have to represent the system accurately for it to be usable. For example, a car steering wheel is made up of many parts, however, to steer the car the user only needs to know how to turn the wheel.</p>
					
				<p>Figure 4: Old versus New filters menu. The old menu [left] has all options at the top level, there’s too much information to understand at a glance. In the new menu [right] filters are visually separated and summarized for easy scanning and identification.</p>

			<div class="left"></div>
			<div class="center">
				<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
				<p>Test after test, I watched participants fail to find what they were looking for, nor could they even find their way back to previous menus. This would happen multiple times for each participant.</p>
				
				<p class="center-column-two">
				<img src="assets/Old_Information_Architecture.png" class="img" alt="Visualization of the new chart building workflow. Including only three steps and removes the error state.">
				Figure 6: The new information architecture. Global options are separated from the tile specific options, which are under the global options and to the right.</p>

				<p class="center-column-one">
				Figure 5: The old information architecture at its worst. On the right you see a stacked menu, with global options above the, too similar, tile-specific options. On the left you will also find a few, isolated options.</p>

				<h2>Exago’s first Usability Testing Session</h2>
				<p>Seeing is believing; with no allotted time for UX research, I made time for moderated usability testing. I chose this method because in addition to testing the proposed solution, I was able to gather task completion metrics and ask real end users specfic questions.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Learnings:</p>
				<p>Asking the right questions at the right time is the hardest part of usability testing. I caught myself asking leading questions, missing opportunities to ask questions, and speaking when I should have been quiet.
				<br/>
				Oftentimes I didn’t dig into questions enough. I would ask something like “Why did you decide to click on X?”  with a response like “I was looking for a way to change this.” I would stop there, instead of continuing down the line of questioning with “How are you trying to change that?”

				<h2>A note on Visual Design</h2>
				<p>In addition to understanding the problem and working with other team members to implement the solution as smoothly as possible, I also sharpened my visual design skills.
				 
				I made a point for us to start using labels, bigger text, and colors that pass the WCAG AAA and AA accessibility standards. Many visual improvements line up with accessibility improvements.
				 
				The marketing team’s graphic designer crafted most of the icons and collaborated with me in design sessions. She really helped me improve my UI design skills, incorporating more color and refining touches to improve the overall look of an interface.
				 
				Figure 7: Adding color and taking it away in other cases, softening edges, and subtle shadows make a world of difference in the final product.</p>

				<h2>Next Steps</h2> 
				<h3>Retrospective Meeting</h3>
				<p>I set up a meeting to capture what the project team thought went well, what didn’t go well, and what specific steps we can take to improve.

				The team determined our “steps to improve” are to introduce more testing on design projects. For me, this is an absolute win. I proved the value of usability testing.</p>
				 
				<h3>Continuous Internal Testing</h3>
				<p>After the 6-month project timeline, I have tested 13 internal employees. There are diminishing returns as known issues are out of scope, and small issues should be ignored and tested by real end users.</p>
				 
				<h3>Continuous External Testing and Feedback</h3>
				<p>As of my writing, we have only just published these changes and have received a few positive sentiments from clients regarding understanding and style improvements. I look forward to reaching out and asking more specific questions.</p>
