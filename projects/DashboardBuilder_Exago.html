					<h1>Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Dashboard Builder</h1>
					<h3>Exago BI</h3>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>When you think of business intelligence (BI) and data analytics the first thing that likely comes to mind is a beautiful Dashboard. What isn’t thought of is the knowledge and work required to create this effortless looking display of key metrics and charts.</p> <h1>Exago’s Dashboard creation experience is outdated, confusing, and frustrating to use; overall a weak point for Exago in the competitive data analytics market.</h1>

Definition: Define the Solution Space based on the primary usability issues and 6-month timeline. Development and Delivery: (Note: Due to the timeline, design meetings, testing, and iterating on the solution took place concurrently with coding the solution.) Build Low Fidelity Prototype to test the hypothesized improvements to chart building and information architecture. Build High Fidelity Designs to ensure design decisions are translated accurately and clearly defined for the development team. Usability Testing using the prototype, we observed client end users complete tasks to find issues with the proposed solution. Testing Result Recommentations and Design Iterations to discuss usability test findings. Determine what is high priority and can be fixed within the time constraints. Iterate on High Fidelity Designs based on the usability test findings. Release a Near-Complete, Coded Solution Internally and perform more usability testing sessions with Exago employees. Release the Solution to Customers. Request for testing and feedback as clients upgrade to the newest version of Exago's BI software.">

Create an intuitive experience that does not confuse or distract potential customers from their most important question: Can Exago Dashbords solve their business problems? Potential customers with a hard requirement for Dashboards would often buy competitor products. Satisfy the expectations to quickly and easily build beautiful Dashboards, like the competition. User Needs: I watched test participants get lost within the interface over and over again. Multiple times per session. Build a clear information architecture to shorten the learning curve, reduce time building Dashboards, and encourage exploration of features. The intersection of Business Goals and User Needs: Customers embed Exago software into their system. The outdated interface affected both the sales team and customer's creditibility Modernize the UI to improve the perceived quality of the product.">

				<h2>Workflow for Creating Charts</h2>

				<p>The old system for building charts would make decisions for the user with intentions of being convenient, but this feature" ended up being unpredictable and confusing. <span>We removed the magic and cut the number of steps in half</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Learnings
				<br/>
				Instead of using our time to test and refine the original workflow, the team assumed we needed something new. many meetings later, we landed close to where we started. We clarified the workflow, but did not address other problems.

				<h2>Consolidate and Simplify Filters</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>There were four different filters that mattered on a technical level, but to the user inevitably did the same thing: limit data on the Dashboard. 
				<br/>
				I consolidated the filters and used consistent styling to convey a simple mental model. I also used progressive disclosure to hide options and information not immediately important. I instead highlighted and answered the three most pertinent questions at this point in the workflow:

				The user's mental model does not have to represent the system accurately for it to be usable. For exmple, a car steering wheel is made up of many parts, however, to steer a car the driver only needs to know how to turn the wheel.</p>

				<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span>The old information architecture caused extreme frustration, a heavy cognitive load, and slowed users down dramatically.</span>Test after test, I watched people get lost in the interface. Almost everyone gave up trying to learn the information architecture and instead would click every section until they stumbled upon whatever they were looking for.
					<br/>
					The new layout was grouped more intutively, labeled clearly, and consistent with Exago's other products.

				<h2>Exago's First Usability Testing Session</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Seeing is believing. With no allotted time for UX research, I made time for moderated usability testing. <span>I chose this method because in addition to testing the proposed solution, I was able to gather task completion metrics and ask specific questions.</span>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Learnings
				<br/>
				Asking the right questions at the right time is the hardest part of usability testing. I caught myself asking leading questions, missing opportunities to ask questions, and speaking when I should have been quiet.
				<br/>
				Oftentimes I didn’t dig into questions enough. I would ask something like “Why did you decide to click on X?”  with a response like “I was looking for a way to change this.” I would stop there, instead of continuing down the line of questioning with “How are you trying to change that?”

				<h2>Visual Design</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Customer's embed the software into their products, so the style needs to feel <span>neutral</span> and blend in. Seccondly, the interface needs to be as simple and <span>minimal</span> as possible because the powerful solution can be easily overwhelming. Finally, I made a point to design <span>accessible</span> elements like labels, bigger text, and contrasting colors that pass WCAG standards.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Learnings
				<br/>
				The marketing team's graphic designer collaborated with me in design sessions, greatly helping me improve my UI design skills. I learned to spend more time zoomed in to refine the small details as well as zoom out to the overall personality and make sure it is cohesive.

				<h2>Outcomes</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>The team held a retrospective meeting to discuss what we had learned from the project. We collectively agreed to introduce more testing in the futre. This was an absolute win - I proved the value of usability testing.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I have recieved positive sentiments from customers and the sales team regarding usability and stle improvements. G2 Crowd reviews also mentioned Dashboards more often as a primary point of value.
