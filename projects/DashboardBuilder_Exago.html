					<h1>Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Dashboard Builder</h1>
					<h3>Exago BI</h3>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>When you think of business intelligence (BI) and data analytics the first thing that likely comes to mind is a beautiful Dashboard. What isn’t thought of is the knowledge and work required to create this effortless looking display of key metrics and charts. <span class="noteable">Exago’s Dashboard creation experience is outdated, confusing, and frustrating to use; overall a weak point for Exago in the competitive data analytics market.</span></p>

				<h2>Consolidate and Simplify Filters</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>There were four different filters that mattered on a technical level, but to the user inevitably did the same thing: limit data on the Dashboard. 
				<br/>
				I consolidated the filters and used consistent styling to convey a simple mental model. I also used progressive disclosure to hide options and information not immediately important. I instead highlighted and answered the three most pertinent questions at this point in the workflow:

				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>The user's mental model does not have to represent the system accurately for it to be usable. For exmple, a car steering wheel is made up of many parts, however, to steer a car the driver only needs to know how to turn the wheel.</p>

				<p>
					<span class="noteable">The old information architecture caused extreme frustration, a heavy cognitive load, and slowed users down dramatically.</span>Test after test, I watched people get lost in the interface. Almost everyone gave up trying to learn the information architecture and instead would click every section until they stumbled upon whatever they were looking for.

					The new layout was grouped more intutively, labeled clearly, and consistent with Exago's other products.

				<h2>Exago's First Usability Testing Session</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Seeing is believing. With no allotted time for UX research, I made time for moderated usability testing. <span class="noteable">I chose this method because in addition to testing the proposed solution, I was able to gather task completion metrics and ask specific questions.</span></p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Asking the right questions at the right time is the hardest part of usability testing. I caught myself asking leading questions, missing opportunities to ask questions, and speaking when I should have been quiet.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Oftentimes I didn’t dig into questions enough. I would ask something like “Why did you decide to click on X?”  with a response like “I was looking for a way to change this.” I would stop there, instead of continuing down the line of questioning with “How are you trying to change that?”
				</p>

				<h2>Visual Design</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Customer's embed the software into their products, so the style needs to feel <span class="noteable">neutral</span> and blend in. Seccondly, the interface needs to be as simple and <span class="noteable">minimal</span> as possible because the powerful solution can be easily overwhelming. Finally, I made a point to design <span class="noteable">accessible</span> elements like labels, bigger text, and contrasting colors that pass WCAG standards.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The marketing team's graphic designer collaborated with me in design sessions, greatly helping me improve my UI design skills. I learned to spend more time zoomed in to refine the small details as well as zoom out to the overall personality and make sure it is cohesive.

				<h2>Outcomes</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>The team held a retrospective meeting to discuss what we had learned from the project. We collectively agreed to introduce more testing in the futre. This was an absolute win - I proved the value of usability testing.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I have recieved positive sentiments from customers and the sales team regarding usability and stle improvements. G2 Crowd reviews also mentioned Dashboards more often as a primary point of value.
