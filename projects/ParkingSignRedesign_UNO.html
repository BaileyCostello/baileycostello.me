				<p>Parking signs hold lots of information in very limited spaces, making them a challenging but fun problem to solve. I take a look at a few less than ideal examples and try my hand at designing my own parking sign.</p>

				<h1 class="primary-font">Introduction</h1>
				<p>Parking signs are often overflowing with rules and information.  They make for great examples of the challenges that come with designing for compromises and the need for careful deliberation. 

				[Figure 1: Examples of cluttered, difficult to read signs.]

				Utilizing gestalt psychology, visual design principles, and  a fairly large amount of information I designed my own parking sign.

				First, I will focus my attention towards the users and the potential problems they face when dealing with a parking sign. I have identified five different groups of people that utilize this sign:

				<ul>
					Regular / Daily Parkers​​
					<li>primary user</li>
					<li>knowledge of rules like parking time limits and times of day</li>
					<li>main goal is to know immediately if a spot is available to park in and where they need to go pay</li>
					<br/>
					Irregular / Special Occasion Parkers
					<li>primary user​</li>
					<li>no knowledge of available spots or times</li>
					<li>main goal is to know immediately if a spot is available, costs money, and how long they can park for without holding up other traffic</li>
					<li>in greatest need of the detailed information presented on the sign</li>
					<br/>
					Cars been Towed 
					<li>secondary user​</li>
					<li>incorrect or no knowledge of rules</li>
					<li>main goal is to understand what happened and what steps they need to take next</li>
					<li>most likely confused and frustrated</li>
					<br/>
					Delivery Drivers
					<li>tertiary user ​</li>
					<li>knowledge of rules and location of businesses</li>
					<li>main goal is to know which spots are available and convenient for loading and unloading</li>
					<br/>
					Police / Rule Enforcement
					<li>facilitator​</li>
					<li>deep knowledge of rules</li>
					<li>main goal is to know which rules apply to a specific parking spot</li>
				</ul>

				After I have identified the users, their prior knowledge, and goals I contemplate how these users interact with parking signs; if at all. The users of parking signs will be using their visual system to read the sign; generally in a vehicle and some of the time in a moving vehicle, otherwise when parked and outside of the car. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the core problems and opportunities relate to the readability and information architecture of the sign. One issue of poorly designed parking signs is that they are extremely wordy. The same messages can be perceived with less words, allowing for a larger, much more readable, font. Signs can be further simplified by placing information in logical groups, allowing for people to be able to parse the information more easily and know where to look. These two points, along with the consideration of what users will be looking for, which information, and in what context will drive the solution of the cluttered sign problem.

				Next, I want to get into an experimental mindset and sketch a few different ideas; keeping the importance of readability and structure at the front of my mind.

				[Figure 2: Five rough-drawn sketches of ideas for the design of the parking sign. Looking at the top left panel, I like to make a note of important details to ensure I do not forget any necessary information, specific user need, or idea I want to incorporate into my design. ]

				I have taken the time to create a few different potential solutions; each with their own pros and cons. Creating five designs rather than focusing on detailing one or two allowed for me to push myself into more creative and different ideas (even if some end up much better than others).  

				Finally, I want to take the best of each of my mini sketches to create one polished solution. Without further ado, here is my parking sign design:

				[Figure 3: My final design.]

				My design utilizes ground and background; making the information easily recognizable and stand apart from detailed information. The daily users won’t have to think twice about the information that is most important to them - where the kiosk is located. The sign is separated into multiple groups and subgroups, allowing the user to quickly parse through which information is relevant for them. 

				Those users that have been towed will have ample time to read the sign and would be standing close to the sign, the information to take further steps is in smaller print at the bottom of the sign. This is not to say that it is not important for all users to understand they could be towed for not abiding to the rules, so the tow zone indication itself is left in the larger font.

				The vertical and horizontal information hierarchy is directly related to the users of the sign, with priority for the irregular parkers. The sign is laid out to be read up to down and left to right. Irregular users are most likely in the area on a Saturday or Sunday for a weekend leisure activity, therefore I chose to present this information first and follow it with similar information for the weekdays. The order of the horizontal information goes time-type-limit. The time of day is represented first as the user needs to know if the following information applies to him or her based on the independent variable of time. If the time is not relevant the information to the right of it does not apply either. The rightmost information clarifies the time limit to park; which is generally considered after the car is already parked. The remaining information follows the complex parking rules, as they are also considered after the car is parked.

				Aside from the content, the color choice is a simple black and white. There is no need for multiple colors as there is enough space to show elements that are related to each other using proximity and symmetry. Black and white are the standard for contrasting colors, taking away the worry of color blindness affecting the visibility of the sign’s information.

				Even a small exercise allowed me to think deeply about the fundamentals of human psychology, user needs, and design principles. The design thinking process helped me to think through the problem and come up with a solution step by step by separating the thought process of understanding the problem and coming up with a solution.
