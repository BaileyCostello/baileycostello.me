					<h1>Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Report Builder</h1>
					<h3>Exago BI</h3>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						A report is a document containing information intended for a specific audience and purpose. They can look as simple as a list of emails or as nuanced as an analysis on business operations; displaying complex calculations, charts, and links to other reports.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Manually creating a report is multiple days worth of work; someone has to query data from a database then clean, run calculations, and present the data in a meaningful way. Exago’s Report Building Platform streamlines this process by making data easily accessible and empowers people with the tools they need to turn data into actionable insights.
					</p>

				<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">The tool looks extremely outdated and new users cannot build a meaningful report without help, two critical issues leading to fewer sales and low adoption rates.</span>

					XX% of potential buyers specifically mentioned the look and feel as one of the reasons they chose a competitor. One prospect said, “This looks like the product we’re trying to leave – if it hadn’t been updated in 3 years.” 

					In addition to this, Exago’s lead sales manager said “When prospects try to build a report themselves and decide it is difficult to use, it’s almost impossible to gain back their trust.” We also heard similar stories from our customers trying to increase user adoption, “People aren’t motivated enough to take on the steep learning curve, they would rather continue to rely on us to build reports for them.

				<h2>User's Perspective</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					We met with customer-facing team members to discuss and focus on the wants, needs, and frustrations of the end-users primarily affected by the project. 
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">The potential buyer</span>
					knows their immediate needs and future wishes from a data analytics tool. They have played with competitor tools, but are overall new to creating reports and dashboards.
					<br/>
					Wants and Needs:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Need to build a set of core reports to see if Exago fulfills their needs</li>
					<li>Needs to present Exago's features to decision-makers without hand holding</li>
					<li>Want to explore and discover features that may be valuable</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Frustrations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Have spent lots of time shopping the heavily saturated business intelligence market</li>
					<li>Struggling with the high learning curve, they seem to always have a list of questions and need help from the Exago Sales team</li>
					<li>Integrating Exago into their system takes a long time</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Buyer's Journey
					<br/>
					I also worked with sales to get a clear picture of the buyer’s journey to empathize with the experience and understand the root product problems.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">The business analyst</span>
					uses Exago BI to build reports on a monthly to bi-monthly basis; and generally enjoys doing so. They have a fundamental knowledge of how databases work; which helps them understand how Exago is working to build reports.
					<br/>
					Wants and Needs:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Should be easy to pick the tool back up after some time away</li>
					<li>Need for advanced features like drill-downs, custom SQL, and complex calculations</li>
					<li>Want to teach others how to use Exago's tool so that they can reduce their workload</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Frustrations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They are building a report in their head before they open the tool. Unnecessary UI slows them from getting their ideas down on paper</li>
					<li>Sometimes redoes work when people ask for one report, but after seeing it request a different one</li>
					<li>Submitting a support ticket when they are unable to complete a task</li>

				<h2>Look and Feel Goals</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">Modern and Professional</span>
					<br/>
					not over-designed.
					<br/>
					The Aesthetic Usability Effect states that users often perceive aesthetically more pleasing designs as more usable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">Obvious Options</span>
					<br/>
					guide the end-user by creating signifiers for previously hidden, important actions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">Fast and Familiar Interaction Design</span>
					<br/>
					Update the grid interactions to use those most common with Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, optimal for working fast.
					<br/>
					Jakob's Law states that users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">Clean and Responsive Report Viewing</span>
					<br/>
					The highest-trafficked page needs to be simple, easy to use, and flexible for all users.

				<h2>Three Egregious Points of Friction</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The first screen for building a report was a wizard, an interface forcing usering into a workflow of predefined steps.
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">For all newly created reports, users skipped optional steps in the wizard 95% of the time. Additionally, closing the wizard transported users to a new page that left them wondering “Where do I start?”</span>
					<br/>
					During demos, even the sales team would gloss over the wizard as quickly as possible. We stripped the five step wizard down to a single dialog sitting on top of the design interface. This created a fast and simple experience that oriented users and helped them anticipate the next screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">New and experienced users alike would run into an annoying error over and over, clearly indicating a “desire path.”</span>
					<br/>
					A Desire Path is the most intuitive, fastest, or most common path for a user to get from A to B, despite it not being designed that way. Because of a technical limitation, we were not able to fully eliminate the step causing people to get into the error state, but we were able to integrate it into the workflow and prevent the error.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">The most important options for building reports were hidden amongst many other, less important icons.</span>
					<br/>
					The information architecture (IA) clearly needed updating. Sensitive to those with years of muscle memory from the old information architecture and no alloted time for research, I had to get creative and find some way to test such a big change to the interface. I knew my chance came when I was offered the opportunity to present at Exago’s client advisory board meeting. Using PowerPoint and Zoom Polling, I created a first click test and recieved 40+ responses in less than two hours. After the meeting, I anaylsed and shared the results by building a report using the same report builder this case study is describing.
					<br/>
					I used the feedback from that session to redesign the information architecture in a way that prioritizes essential options.

				<h2>Outcomes</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					[XX% more sales]
					[Positive Client Feedback - more clients upgrading to the newest version of Exago.]
					[Based on a post-conference survey, my presentation where I performed a First Click testing exercise was the most positively rated talk]
					Progressively getting more and more user-centric, user stories as a starting point for the project and having more conversations with clients and client-facing teammates.
