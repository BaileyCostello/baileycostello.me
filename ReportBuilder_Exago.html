					<h1>Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Report Builder</h1>
					<h3>Exago BI</h3>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						A report is a document containing information intended for a specific audience and purpose. They can look as simple as a list of emails or as nuanced as an analysis on business operations; displaying complex calculations, charts, and links to other reports.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Manually creating a report is multiple days' worth of work; someone has to query data from a database, clean, run calculations, and present the data in a meaningful way. Exago’s Report Building Platform streamlines this process by making data easily accessible and empowers people with the tools they need to turn data into actionable insights.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

				<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">The tool looks extremely outdated and new users cannot build a meaningful report without help, two critical issues leading to fewer sales and low adoption rates.</span>

					Over half of all potential buyers specifically mentioned the look and feel as one of the reasons they chose a competitor. One prospect said, “This looks like the product we’re trying to leave – if it hadn’t been updated in 3 years.” 

					In addition to this, Exago’s lead sales manager said “When prospects try to build a report themselves and decide it is difficult to use, it’s almost impossible to gain back their trust.” We also heard similar stories from our customers trying to increase user adoption, “People aren’t motivated enough to take on the steep learning curve, they would rather continue to rely on us to build reports for them.

				<h2>User's Perspective</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					We met with customer-facing team members to discuss and focus on the end-user's wants, needs, and frustrations primarily affected by the project. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">The potential buyer</span>
					knows their immediate needs and future wishes from a data analytics tool. They have played with competitor tools, but are overall new to creating reports and dashboards.
					<br/>
					Wants and Needs:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Need to build a set of core reports to see if Exago fulfills their needs</li>
					<li>Needs to present Exago's features to decision-makers without hand holding</li>
					<li>Want to explore and discover features that may be valuable</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Frustrations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Have spent lots of time shopping the heavily saturated business intelligence market</li>
					<li>Struggling with the high learning curve, they seem to always have a list of questions and need help from the Exago Sales team</li>
					<li>Integrating Exago into their system takes a long time</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<!-- <p>
					<br/>
					I worked with sales to map out the buyer's journey to highlight when difficulties arose and perspective on what happened before and after these points of friction.

					<span class="noteable">The business analyst</span>
					uses Exago BI to build reports on a monthly to bi-monthly basis; and generally enjoys doing so. They have a fundamental knowledge of how databases work; which helps them understand how Exago is working to build reports.
					<br/>
					Wants and Needs:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Should be easy to pick the tool back up after some time away</li>
					<li>Need for advanced features like drill-downs, custom SQL, and complex calculations</li>
					<li>Want to teach others how to use Exago's tool so that they can reduce their workload</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Frustrations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They are building a report in their head before they open the tool. Unnecessary UI slows them from getting their ideas down on paper</li>
					<li>Sometimes redoes work when people ask for one report, but after seeing it request a different one</li>
					<li>Submitting a support ticket when they are unable to complete a task</li>

					Jakob's Law states that users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

				<h2>Three Egregious Points of Friction</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">1. </span>The first screen for building a report was a wizard, an interface forcing users into a workflow of predefined steps.
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">For all newly created reports, users skipped optional steps in the wizard 99% of the time. Additionally, closing the wizard transported users to a new page that left them wondering “Where do I start?”</span>
					<br/>
					We stripped the bloated, five-step wizard down to a single dialog. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/ARWizard.png" style="width: 100%;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					Even the sales team would gloss over the counter-productive wizard as quickly as possible.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/ARDialog.png" style="width: 100%;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					The new dialog sits on top of the design interface, creating a fast and simple experience that oriented users and helped them anticipate the next screen.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">2. New and experienced users alike would run into an annoying error over and over, indicating a “desire path.”</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					A Desire Path is the most intuitive, fastest, or most common path for a user to get from A to B, despite it not being designed that way. Because of a technical limitation, we were not able to fully eliminate the step causing people to get into the error state, but we were able to integrate it into the workflow and prevent the error.
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">3. The most important options for building reports were hidden amongst many other, less important icons.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Sensitive to those with years of muscle memory and no allocated time for research, I had to find a way to test the information architecture (IA). My chance came when I was offered the opportunity to present at Exago’s client advisory board meeting. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I displayed an image of the IA during my presentation, where areas that people might click were marked with numbers (including red herrings to account for unexpected answers). I asked, "Where would you first click to do..." questions and had people answer via a Zoom Poll.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">I successfully received over 20 responses in less than two hours.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Ironically, I used the report viewer this case study is based on to analyze and share the test results:

				<h2>Outcomes</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The reporting tool serves as the primary way Exago provides value to customers, however, the learning curve was unnecessarily high and intimidated new users as well as potential buyers. This project focused on improving the look and feel, learnability, and efficiency of the product. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Exago's current application is not set up to collect usage metrics like the number of errors hit, features used, and time in the tool. Despite this, we observed some changes that indicated a successful project.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The prior year's release forced clients to go through a painful upgrade process and many clients opted not to upgrade. After they learned about the release including the changes described here, more clients started the upgrade process.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					By removing the wizard and streamlining the workflow that contained an error state, we have saved users an estimated thirty seconds every time they build a report.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to the project's successes, the product team also had some beneficial outcomes. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Based on a post-conference survey, the session where I performed the first-click test was the highest-rated presentation out of all sessions. Customers enjoyed being a part of the design process, getting their voice heard, and engaging in the collaborative presentation. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Additionally, we agreed that kicking off the project with user stories was insightful and helped the team become more user-focused. Since then, we have created user stories for two other projects which have become essential for keeping track of important use cases, guiding design meetings, and facilitating conversations with customer-facing teams and clients.
