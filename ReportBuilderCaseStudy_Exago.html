					The goal of this project was to make the sales evaluation process more effective and ultimately secure more deals. The Exago sales team was experiencing a year-long lull in sales. To combat this, the CEO decided to make a sudden and dramatic change to the roadmap. The product team dropped everything to elevate core product offerings, including Exago’s most valuable and best selling report building platform.

				<h2>Team and Timeline</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The product team consisted of myself and the VP of Product Management, Alex Agoado. I did the preliminary discovery research, user experience design, interface design, and tested the solution. Alex facilitated the persona discussion, wrote the specification document, and managed ongoing conversations around the project’s scope. We also met weekly with 5 people from the Development and Quality Assurance teams to discuss technical limitations, design for edge cases, and monitor the project’s progress.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The report builder redesign had an 8 month timeline. The product team was also working on three other projects - one large and two small projects that required our attention.

				<h2>Personas</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					We kicked off the project by meeting with customer-facing and sales team members to discuss who we were primarily designing for. We asked questions to understand Exago user’s goals, responsibilities, and frustrations. 

					After exploring seven different personalities and job titles, we distilled the conversation down to two personas. We ultimately wanted to focus on those who lined up with the overall business goals of the project, the potential buyers, and account for the product’s existing target audience.

				<h2>Interviews</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I met with Exago’s senior sales engineer, Nick Avossa, to understand why and what was causing people to say no to Exago's report creation tool. During our conversation two unforgiving comments stood out that summarize the first problem well:
				</p>
				<br/>
						<div style="text-align: center;" class="gradient-border-wrap-card">
							<div class="gradient-border-card">
								<span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">“</span> There’s an immediate negative reaction when sales introduces the advanced report designer to prospects. <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">”</span></span>
								<br/>
								<br/>
								<span style="font-size: 14px;">
								Nick Avossa, Senior Sales Engineer</span>
								<br/>
							</div>
						</div>
						<br/>
						<br/>
					<div style="text-align: center;" class="gradient-border-wrap-card">
						<div class="gradient-border-card">
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
								<span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">“</span> This looks like the product we're trying to leave - if it hadn't been updated in 3 years. <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">”</span>
							</span>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<span style="font-size: 14px;">
							One buyer during a sales call</span>
							<br/>
						</div>
					</div>
				<br/>
				<p>
					These comments weren’t all that surprising; the reporting tool’s look and feel hadn’t been updated since it’s inception in 2006. However, it was suprising to hear that more than half of lost deals specifically mentioned the outdated interface as one of the reasons they chose a competitor over Exago.
				</p>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/OldAdvancedReportDesigner.png"></img>
				<p class="figure">The report builder interface before the redesign.</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Buyer's Journey</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Next, I wanted to pinpoint when the sales team would run into points of friction with the buyer and how they would handle it. I asked Nick to walk me through the entire buyer’s journey and point out where the biggest issues arose.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/Buyers Journey.png"></img>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Nick explained a major pitfall when the buyer attempted to use Exago on their own without the sales team to guide them. The learning curve was unnecessarily high and people couldn’t figure out how to build even a simple report. This results in the buyer stuggling so see how they, or anyone else, could get value out of the product. When this happens, the buyers lose all trust that this might be a good solution for them and the Exago salesperson has a very hard time recovering from it.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					After establishing that the usability was very low, I wanted to know where they were stumbling throughout this process, and moreso wanted to see if people could build even a simple report. If a buyer could get that far on their own - they could feel a sense of accomplishment, prove some value of the product, and know that they and their colleagues could in fact learn the tool. To test this, I put together a few rounds usability testing. The sessions highlighted unhelpful, unintuitive workflows and difficulties navigating the interface. These points of friction together greatly impacted the onboarding experience and overall left people feeling frustrated.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Through this discovery work and long term feedback, we were armed with a strong understanding of the problems we faced and a clear direction of what to address under our limited timeline.

				<h2>Three Egregious Points of Friction</h2>
				<h3>Found from Usability Testing</h3>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>1. The Forced Wizard Workflow</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					When someone clicks the button to create a new report, they are transported here:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/ARWizard.png" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF;">
				<br/>
				<p>
					The application forced people through a wizard set up process before they could start building a report.
					This was not only an ugly starting point, but one that caught people off guard and ultimately left them extremely underwhelmed or even confused. People expected to start playing with a new shiny reporting toy, but instead they were thrown into an unnatural workflow. For example, the first step in the wizard was to name the report - which implied the user knew what they wanted before they got a chance to explore the tool and its options.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Additionally, the wizard was bloated and time consuming. Only two of the five steps were required. For all newly created reports, users skipped optional steps in the wizard 99% of the time. Even the sales team would glaze over the "feature" as quickly as possible.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Finally, once a user exited the wizard they could not get back to it, meaning they had to re-learn how they did everything again from the actual report builder interface.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					We stopped forcing people to save their report first and stripped the five-step wizard down to a single dialog, saving people an estimated 17 seconds every time they build a report.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/ARDialog.png" style="width: 80%;border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					The new dialog sits on top of the design interface, creating a fast and simple experience that oriented users and helped them anticipate the next screen.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>2. A Desire Path Blocked by an Error State</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					New and experienced users alike would run into an annoying error over and over, indicating a “desire path.” A Desire Path is the most intuitive, fastest, or most common path for a user to get from A to B, despite it not being designed that way. Because of a technical limitation, we were not able to fully eliminate the step causing people to get into the error state, but we were able to integrate it into the workflow and prevent the error.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/New and Old Workflow.png" style="width: 35%;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					The old workflow is shown on the left and the new, streamlined workflow is shown on the right.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>3. The Information Architecture</h2>
				<br/>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="two-column-content">
						<img class="img-center" src="assets/OldExagoIA.png">
						<br/>
						<p class="figure">
							I watcched many people hovering over every single icon in an attempt to find what they were looking for.
						</p>
					</div>

					<br/>
					<div class="two-column-content">
						<img class="img-center" src="assets/OldExagoIAMenu.png">
						<br/>
						<p class="figure">
							The most important options for building reports were hidden amongst many other, less important icons.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p> 
					I worked on bringing the options people use for nearly every report to the top level and introduced labels to make the interface easy to scan.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>First Click Testing</h2>
				<br/>
				<p> 
					Regardless of the fact that I had no allocated time for research, I was Sensitive to those with years of muscle memory and knew I had to find a way to test the information architecture. My chance came when I was offered the opportunity to present at Exago’s client conference. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<img class="img-center" src="assets/IATest.png">
					<br/>
					During my presentation I displayed an image of my design, where areas that people might click were marked with numbers (including red herrings to account for unexpected answers). I asked, "Where would you first click to ..." questions and had people answer via a Zoom Poll.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Ironically, I used the report viewer this case study is based on to analyze and share the test results:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/FirstClickTestSummary.png"></img>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					This was an exciting moment for me, I successfully received over 20 responses with a total time investment of three hours - including the time it took to craft the test. On top of that, my presentation was rated highest of 8 speakers based on a post-conference survey.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Ultimately, this was final design for the information architecture.

				<h2>Impact</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The reporting tool serves as the primary way Exago provides value to customers, however, the learning curve was unnecessarily high and intimidated new users as well as potential buyers. This project focused on improving the look and feel, learnability, and efficiency of the product. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Exago's current application is not set up to collect usage metrics like the number of errors hit, features used, and time in the tool. Despite this, we observed some changes that indicated a successful project.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The prior year's release forced clients to go through a painful upgrade process and many clients opted not to upgrade. After they learned about the release including the changes described here, more clients started the upgrade process.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					By removing the wizard and streamlining the workflow that contained an error state, we have saved users an estimated thirty seconds every time they build a report.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to the project's successes, the product team also had some beneficial outcomes.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Additionally, we agreed that kicking off the project with user stories was insightful and helped the team become more user-focused. Since then, we have created user stories for two other projects which have become essential for keeping track of important use cases, guiding design meetings, and facilitating conversations with customer-facing teams and clients.
