					The goal of this project was to make the sales evaluation process more effective and ultimately secure more deals. The Exago sales team was experiencing a year-long lull in sales. To combat this, the CEO decided to make a sudden and dramatic change to the roadmap. The product team dropped everything to elevate core product offerings, including Exago’s most valuable and best selling report building platform.

				<h2>Team and Timeline</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The product team consisted of myself and the VP of Product Management, Alex Agoado. I did the preliminary discovery research, user experience design, interface design, and tested the solution. Alex facilitated the persona discussion, wrote the specification document, and managed ongoing conversations around the project’s scope. We also met weekly with five people from the Development and Quality Assurance teams to monitor the project's progress, discuss technical limitations, and design for edge cases.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The report builder redesign had an 8 month timeline. During this time, the product team was also working on three other projects - one large project and two smaller projects.

				<h2>Personas</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					We kicked off the project by meeting with customer-facing and sales team members to discuss who we were primarily designing for. We asked questions to understand Exago user’s goals, responsibilities, and frustrations. 

					After exploring seven different personalities and job titles, we distilled the conversation down to two personas. We ultimately wanted to focus on those who lined up with the overall business goals of the project, the potential buyers, and also account for the product’s existing target audience.

				<h2>Interviews</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I met with Exago’s senior sales engineer, Nick Avossa, to understand why and what was causing people to say no to Exago's report creation tool. During our conversation, two unforgiving comments stood out and summarize the first problem well:
				</p>
				<br/>

			<div style="text-align: center;" class="gradient-border-wrap-card">
				<div class="gradient-border-card">
					<span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
						<span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">“</span> This looks like the product we're trying to leave - if it hadn't been updated in 3 years. <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">”</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="font-size: 14px;">
					One buyer during a sales call</span>
					<br/>
				</div>
			</div>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					These comments weren’t all that surprising; the reporting tool’s look and feel hadn’t been updated since it’s inception in 2006. However, it was suprising to hear that more than half of lost deals specifically mentioned the outdated interface as one of the reasons they chose a competitor over Exago.
				</p>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/OldAdvancedReportDesigner.png"></img>
				<p class="figure">The report builder interface before the redesign.</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Buyer's Journey</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Next, I wanted to pinpoint when the sales team would run into points of friction with the buyer and how they would handle it. I asked Nick to walk me through the entire buyer’s journey and point out where the biggest issues arose.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/Buyers Journey.png"></img>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Nick explained a major pitfall when the buyer got ahead of the sales team and tried to use Exago without guidance. The learning curve was unnecessarily high and people couldn’t figure out how to build even a simple report. The sales team had a very hard time recovering from this; it caused the buyer to distrust the salesperson and made them sceptical that they, or anyone else, could get value out of the product.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					After establishing that the usability was very low, I wanted to know where they were stumbling throughout this process, and moreso wanted to see if people could build a basic report. If a buyer could get that far on their own - they could feel a sense of accomplishment, prove some value of the product, and know that they and their colleagues could in fact learn the tool. To test this, I put together a few rounds usability testing. The sessions highlighted unhelpful, unintuitive workflows and difficulties navigating the interface. These points of friction together greatly impacted the onboarding experience and overall left people feeling frustrated.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Through this discovery work and long term feedback, we were armed with a strong understanding of the problems we faced and a clear direction of what to address under our limited timeline.

				<h2>Three Egregious Points of Friction</h2>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>1. The Forced Wizard Workflow</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The application forced people through a set up process before they could start building a report. When someone clicks the button to create a new report, they are transported here:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/ARWizard.png" style="width: 80%; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF;">
				<br/>
				<p>
					This was a bloated, ugly starting point that left people feeling underwhelmed and confused. People expected to start playing with a new shiny reporting toy, but instead they were thrown into an unnatural workflow.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					We stripped the five-step wizard down to a single dialog, saving people an estimated 17 seconds every time they build a report.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/ARDialog.png" style="width: 80%;border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					The new dialog sits on top of the design interface, creating a fast and simple experience that oriented users and helped them anticipate the next screen.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>2. A Desire Path Blocked by an Error State</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					New and experienced users alike would run into an annoying error over and over, indicating a “desire path.” A Desire Path is the most intuitive, fastest, or most common path for a user to get from A to B, despite it not being designed that way. Because of a technical limitation, we were not able to fully eliminate the step causing people to get into the error state, but we were able to integrate it into the workflow and prevent the error.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/New and Old Workflow.png" style="width: 35%;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					The old workflow is shown on the left and the new, streamlined workflow is shown on the right.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>3. The Information Architecture</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I watcched people spend lots of time trying to locate options. They would end up hovering over every single icon before finding what they were looking for.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="two-column-content">
						<img class="img-center" src="assets/OldExagoIA.png">

					<div class="two-column-content">

					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="figure">The most important options for building reports were hidden under a single icon, amongst many other less important icons.</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p> 
					I worked on bringing the options people use for nearly every report to the top level and introduced labels to make the toolbar easy to scan.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/PreliminaryIA.png" style="border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF;"></img>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>First-Click Testing</h2>
				<br/>
				<p> 
					Regardless of the fact that I had no allocated time for research, I was sensitive to those with years of muscle memory. I knew I had to find a way to test the information architecture - and my chance came when I was offered the opportunity to present at Exago’s client conference. I used my presentation to a facilitate a first-click test over zoom. I displayed an image of the proposed design and asked, "Where would you first click to ..." questions where people answered via a poll.
				</p>  
				<br/>
				<br/> 
				<p>
					Ironically, I used the report designer to analyze and share the test results:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/FirstClickTestSummary.png" style="width: 80%;"></img>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					This was an exciting moment for me, I successfully received over twenty responses with a total time investment of three hours - including the time it took to craft the test. On top of that, my presentation was rated the highest of eight speakers based on a post-conference survey.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Ultimately, this was final design for the information architecture:
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<img class="img-center" src="assets/FinalIA.png" style="border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF;"></img>
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					After redesigning the grid interface, information architecture, and core workflows, the final product was much improved from the original.

				<h2>Impact</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The goal of this project was to make the sales evaluation process more effective and ultimately to overcome the lull in sales from 2020.
				</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<img class="img-center" style="border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF; width: 90%;" src="assets/NewSalesAndMaintenanceRevenueByYear.png"></img>
					<br/>
					<p class="figure">
						2018 and 2019 were Exago's best years for gaining new clients, but that momentum crashed in 2020.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
				<p>
					In Q3 of 2021, Exago was acquired. Therefore we will never know what potential return could have been, but we can look at the first two quarters. We see that Q1 and Q2 had better results than 2020 and is comparable to Exago's best years, 2018 and 2019 - a sign that we were poised to have a great year in sales.  
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<img class="img-center" style="border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #C7CACF; width: 90%;" src="assets/NewSalesAndMaintenanceRevenueByQuarter.png"></img>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					This data is not enough to qualify the project's impact, nor does it tell the story of outside factors - like turnover in the sales department, the COVID-19 pandemic, and fluctuations in the BI market.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I spoke with Nick eight months after the project to capture his qualitative perspective. He noticed buyers asking fewer questions and stopped having a severe negative reaction to the interface, but people still needed at least some training to use the tool effectively. The usability improvements helped, but were not enough to guide people to build a realistic report without help.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Turning to existing customers, the team captured a great indication that people were looking forward to the latest and greatest improvements to Exago. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</p>
					<div style="text-align: center;" class="gradient-border-wrap-card">
						<div class="gradient-border-card">
							<span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">14 of 80 clients upgraded to the new release,</span>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<span style="font-size: 14px;">
							compared to 4 clients for the last release.</span>
							<br/>
						</div>
					</div>
				<p>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					These numbers seem small, but the upgrade process is a resource intensive process that clients need to plan for and get executive buy-in. It can take clients from three months up to a year to update Exago. This release clearly motivated our clients to deal with that painful process - indicating the project added a lot of value for existing customers.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The report builder redesign was long awaited and in my opinion a great success. The product team took a much more user-centric approach to this project, and it paid off with undoubtedly valuable improvements. Thank you for reading!
