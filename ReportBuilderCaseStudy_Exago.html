					The Exago sales team was experiencing a year-long lull in sales. To combat this, the CEO decided to make a sudden and dramatic change to the roadmap. The product team dropped everything to elevate core product offerings, including Exago’s most valuable and best selling report building platform. The goal of this project was to make the sales evaluation process more effective and ultimately secure more deals.

				<h2>Team and Timeline</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Exago had a very small but talented team. The combined efforts of the product, development, and quality assurance teams were able to make quality improvements, proactively manage priorities, and meet aggressive deadlines.

					The product team consisted of myself and the VP of product, Alex Agoado. I did the preliminary discovery research, user experience design, interface design, and tested the solution. Alex facilitated the persona discussion, wrote the specification document, and managed ongoing conversations around the project’s scope. We also met weekly with 5 people from the development and QA team to discuss technical limitations, design for edge cases that came up during development, and closely monitor the project’s progress.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The report builder project had an 8 month timeline and was running in parallel with one other major project and two other small projects that required our attention.

				<h2>Personas</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					We kicked off the project by meeting with customer-facing and sales team members to discuss who we were primarily designing for. We asked questions to understand Exago user’s goals, responsibilities, and frustrations. 

					After exploring seven different personalities and job titles, we distilled the conversation down to two personas. We ultimately wanted to focus on those who lined up with the overall business goals of the project, the potential buyers, and account for the product’s existing target audience.

				<h2>Interviews and Buyer's Journey</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I met with Exago’s senior sales engineer, Nick Avossa, to understand why and what was causing people to say no to Exago's report creation tool. During our conversation two unforgiving comments stood out that summarize the first problem well:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<div style="text-align: center;" class="gradient-border-wrap-card">
					<div class="gradient-border-card">
						<span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">“</span> There’s an immediate negative reaction when sales introduces the advanced report designer to prospects. <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">”</span></span>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<span style="font-size: 14px;">
						Nick Avossa, Senior Sales Engineer</span>
						<br/>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<div style="text-align: center;" class="gradient-border-wrap-card">
					<div class="gradient-border-card">
						<span style="font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
							<span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">“</span> This looks like the product we're trying to leave - if it hadn't been updated in 3 years. <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 20px;">”</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<span style="font-size: 14px;">
						One buyer during a sales call</span>
						<br/>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					These comments weren’t all that surprising; the reporting tool’s look and feel hadn’t been updated since it’s inception in 2006. However, it was suprising to hear that more than half of lost deals specifically mentioned the outdated interface as one of the reasons they chose a competitor over Exago.
				</p>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/OldAdvancedReportDesigner.png"></img>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Next, I wanted to pinpoint when the sales team would run into points of friction with the buyer and how they would handle it. I asked Nick to walk me through the entire buyer’s journey and point out where the biggest issues arose.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img class="img-center" src="assets/Buyers Journey.png"></img>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Nick explained a major pitfall when the buyer attempted to use Exago on their own without the sales team to guide them. The learning curve was unnecessarily high and people couldn’t figure out how to build even a simple report. This results in the buyer stuggling so see how they, or anyone else, could get value out of the product. When this happens, the buyers lose all trust that this might be a good solution for them and the Exago salesperson has a very hard time recovering from it.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					After establishing that the usability was very low, I wanted to know where they were stumbling throughout this process, and moreso wanted to see if people could build even a simple report. If a buyer could get that far on their own - they could feel a sense of accomplishment, prove some value of the product, and know that they and their colleagues could in fact learn the tool. To test this, I put together a few rounds usability testing. 
					<br/>
					<br/>					
					The usability sessions highlighted unhelpful, unintuitive workflows and difficulties navigating the interface. These points of friction together greatly impacted the onboarding experience and overall left people feeling frustrated.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Through this discovery work and long term feedback, we were armed with a strong understanding of the problems we face and a clear direction of what to address under our limited timeline.

				<h2>Three Egregious Points of Friction</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">1. </span>The first screen for building a report was a wizard, an interface forcing users into a workflow of predefined steps.
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">For all newly created reports, users skipped optional steps in the wizard 95% of the time. Additionally, closing the wizard transported users to a new page that left them wondering “Where do I start?”</span>
					<br/>
					We stripped the bloated, five-step wizard down to a single dialog. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<img src="assets/ARWizard.png" style="width: 100%;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					Even the sales team would gloss over the counter-productive wizard as quickly as possible.

				<br/>
				<img src="assets/ARDialog.png" style="width: 100%;">
				<br/>
				<p class="figure">
					The new dialog sits on top of the design interface, creating a fast and simple experience that oriented users and helped them anticipate the next screen.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<span class="noteable">2. New and experienced users alike would run into an annoying error over and over, indicating a “desire path.”</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					A Desire Path is the most intuitive, fastest, or most common path for a user to get from A to B, despite it not being designed that way. Because of a technical limitation, we were not able to fully eliminate the step causing people to get into the error state, but we were able to integrate it into the workflow and prevent the error.

					<span class="noteable">3. The most important options for building reports were hidden amongst many other, less important icons.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Sensitive to those with years of muscle memory and no allocated time for research, I had to find a way to test the information architecture (IA). My chance came when I was offered the opportunity to present at Exago’s client advisory board meeting. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I displayed an image of the IA during my presentation, where areas that people might click were marked with numbers (including red herrings to account for unexpected answers). I asked, "Where would you first click to do..." questions and had people answer via a Zoom Poll.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span class="noteable">I successfully received over 20 responses in less than two hours.</span>
					<br/>

					Ironically, I used the report viewer this case study is based on to analyze and share the test results:

				<h2>Impact</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The reporting tool serves as the primary way Exago provides value to customers, however, the learning curve was unnecessarily high and intimidated new users as well as potential buyers. This project focused on improving the look and feel, learnability, and efficiency of the product. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Exago's current application is not set up to collect usage metrics like the number of errors hit, features used, and time in the tool. Despite this, we observed some changes that indicated a successful project.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The prior year's release forced clients to go through a painful upgrade process and many clients opted not to upgrade. After they learned about the release including the changes described here, more clients started the upgrade process.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					By removing the wizard and streamlining the workflow that contained an error state, we have saved users an estimated thirty seconds every time they build a report.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to the project's successes, the product team also had some beneficial outcomes. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Based on a post-conference survey, the session where I performed the first-click test was the highest-rated presentation out of all sessions. Customers enjoyed being a part of the design process, getting their voice heard, and engaging in the collaborative presentation. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Additionally, we agreed that kicking off the project with user stories was insightful and helped the team become more user-focused. Since then, we have created user stories for two other projects which have become essential for keeping track of important use cases, guiding design meetings, and facilitating conversations with customer-facing teams and clients.
